# Not So Griddy
 Code for paper ["Not so griddy: Internal representations of RNNs path integrating more than one agent"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.29.596500v1.abstract) Redman et al. bioRxiv (2024). This codes is built upon the [code framework](https://github.com/ganguli-lab/grid-pattern-formation/tree/master) of [Sorscher et al. NeurIPS (2019)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/6e7d5d259be7bf56ed79029c4e621f44-Abstract.html) and adds a second agent that the RNN must path integrate. 

Scripts to train your own single and dual agent RNN can be found in the **Code** folder. Saved trained models can be found in the **Models** folder. Code to visualize the internal representations and re-make the plots from the paper can be found in the **Plotting** folder. 

Any questions/comments can be sent to will.redman@jhuapl.edu.
